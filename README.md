# Welcome to the SS23_ADSP_TCF Repository!

This is an official repository for the `Tangible Climate Futures` project for the `(Advanced) Distributed Systems Prototyping SS23` course at TU Berlin. The description and the structure of our project, together with a detailed structure of implemented JSON objects, can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/Corgam/SS23_ADSP_TCF/wiki).

Project Developers:

- **Simon Albani** (Frontend, User Authentication)
- **Emil Balitzki** (Backend: Public-API, MongoDB, Filtering)
- **Theodor Barkow** (Frontend, Team Leader)
- **Alexander Guttenberger** (Backend: Public-API, Python)
- **Florian JÃ¤ger** (Frontend)
- **Frederik Stalschus** (Development Features & Deployment, Backend: Python)

# Project Deployment

Our Project can be deployed in multiple ways, including full-Docker deployment, developer deployment and on Google Cloud Platform (using Terraform).

## Docker Deployment

The full-Docker deployment is the recommended way for using the application, where all of the components are deployed as individual Docker containers. If you are a developer, you can use the Developer Deployment described in section below. While we have tested this deployment on a clean `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish, 64-bit)`, it should work on all machines with Docker installed.

Setup:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and run the Docker Daemon (for Ubuntu follow the [Docker Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and the [Docker Compose Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)).
2. Install Git and clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/Corgam/SS23_ADSP_TCF`)
3. Inside the root folder run `npm run deploy`, which will deploy all necessary Docker containers (including FE, BE and all microservices). Make sure that the Docker Service is running.

- Frontend is hosted at `localhost:8080`
- Backend Public API (Express.js) server is hosted at `localhost:40000`, with Swagger end-points documentation accessible at `localhost:40000/docs`.
- All microservices (and their containers) should not be accessible outside the main Public API service.

## Developer Deployment (reduced-Docker)

The developer deployment (or reduced-Docker) is a deployment recommended for developing the project. All components, except MongoDB, are deployed locally (no Docker containers) allowing for easier CI/CD developement. This deployment was tested on a clean `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish, 64-bit)`.

Setup:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and run the Docker Daemon (for Ubuntu follow the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and install Docker Compose `sudo apt install docker-compose`).
2. Install Git and npm (Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git npm`).
3. Inside `frontend/src/environments/` folder, fill in the Firebase API keys in files: `environment.ts` and `environment.development.ts`
4. Go to the root folder and run `npm run setup` to install all necessary npm packages.
5. Install the `Concurrently` package globaly `npm install -g concurrently`
6. Run (Ubuntu: `npm run linux:dev:all`, Windows: `npm run dev:all`) to run all components as the dev version (live reloading) as background processes. The MongoDB will be still deployed as a Docker container, thus make sure that the Docker Service is running.

Note: The processes for all components will be run in the background, thus for easier developement of individual components, use specific npm scripts, described at the bottom of the README. These scripts will allow for deployment of individual services in seperate terminals.

## Cloud Deployment (GCP using Terraform)

This cloud deployment will deploy our complete project on GCP using Terraform. It is intended to be used as a production-ready deployment, thus for making the project publicly available.

1. Firstly install the [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).
2. Download the GCP access keys (be aware to not commit it) from [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) and save them as a JSON file on your machine.
3. Create an environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/key.json`
4. Inside our project, go to the `deploy` directory using `cd deploy`
5. Setup your terraform environment with `terraform init`
6. Apply the infrastructure with `terraform apply`, you can access the app under the provided above URLs.
7. For shutdown use `terraform destroy`.

# Useful Scripts for MongoDB

Once the project is set up, and the MongoDB container is running, you can execute some helpful scripts:

Setup:

- Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/).
- Install pip packages `pip install pymongo faker`
  - [PyMongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/) this library provides a Python interface for connecting to and interacting with MongoDB.
  - [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) is a Python library used for generating fake data, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and more. It is utilized in this script to create realistic-looking data.

Note: Make sure you have the MongoDB instance running.

## Seed the Database with Random Data

To seed the database with random documents, use the following command `python scripts/mongo/main.py seed`

Options:

- `--num-documents <int>` - the number of documents to seed (default 10).
- `--mongo-url <string>`- the URL to the database (default `mongodb://localhost:27017/datastore`)
- Example: `python scripts/mongo/main.py seed --num-documents 20 --mongo-url mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase`

## Cleanup the Database

To clean up the database, simply run the following command `python scripts/mongo/main.py cleanup --mongo-url <string>`

- Example: `python scripts/mongo/main.py cleanup --mongo-url mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase`
